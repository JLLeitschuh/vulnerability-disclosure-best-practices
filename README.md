# Vulnerability Disclosure Best Practices

> From a security researchers perspective, it's infinitely simpler to just drop an 0-day blog post on twitter, then dump the research on MITRE, Snyk, and WhiteSource and let them deal with issuing advisories.

> By privately disclosing a security vulnerability to an organization, a security researcher is offering respect, not only to the organization, but more importantly to the users of that organizations software.

## Best practice #1: Have a Disclosure Policy

As a security researcher, when disclosing a security vulnerability to an organization, having an established and up-front disclosure policy is important.

This disclosure policy should be clearly stated in the intial email contact and should have a well-defined disclosure date.
